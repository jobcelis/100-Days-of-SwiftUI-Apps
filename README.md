# 100-Days-of-SwiftUI-Apps

This repository contains certain SwiftUI apps that I build by following the **100 Days of SwiftUI** challenge by Paul Hudson.

Each folder is a separate project from the course, with my own modifications to them

Feel free to go thru them, download them, and play around with them

## Running the Projects

1. Open any app’s `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
2. Build and run on the iOS simulator or device.
